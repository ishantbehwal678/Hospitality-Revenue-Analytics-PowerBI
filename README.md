# Hospitality-Revenue-Analytics-PowerBI

End-to-end Power BI data analytics project analyzing hotel revenue performance in the hospitality domain. Includes data modeling, DAX measure creation, KPI tracking, stakeholder-driven dashboard development, and business insight generation for revenue optimization.

=================================

Project Overview

-This project simulates working as a data analyst for a multinational hotel chain, Atle GRS, operating across multiple cities in India.
-The objective was to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides key revenue and performance insights to management, enabling data-driven decisions in a competitive hospitality market.
-The project follows the complete analytics lifecycle — requirement gathering, data modeling, measure creation, dashboard design, validation, and stakeholder feedback.

Dataset

Multiple CSV files representing hospitality business operations:
-Bookings (fact table)
-Aggregated bookings
-Hotels (property details)
-Room types
-Date table
The dataset includes information on revenue, booking status, room capacity, cancellations, no-shows, booking platforms, and city-level performance.

Tools & Technologies

-Power BI – Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard creation
-Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
-DAX – KPI calculations and advanced business metrics

Work Performed
4.1 Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)

-Imported multiple CSV datasets
-Promoted headers and removed unnecessary columns
-Created calculated columns (weekend vs weekday classification)
-Standardized data for modeling
-Prepared cleaned data for star schema modeling

4.2 Data Modeling

-Built relationships between fact and dimension tables
-Implemented a star schema structure
-Connected bookings with hotels, rooms, and date tables
-Enabled efficient slicing by city, room type, and time

4.3 DAX Measure Creation

Created key hospitality performance measures including:
-Total Revenue
-Total Bookings
-RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)
-ADR (Average Daily Rate)
-Occupancy Percentage
-Realization (URN ÷ BRN)
-DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)
-Booked Room Nights (BRN)
-Utilized Room Nights (URN)
-Week-on-Week and Month-on-Month % change
These measures form the foundation of the executive dashboard.

4.4 Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Built an interactive revenue performance dashboard including:
-KPI Cards (Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, Realization, DSRN)
-Weekly and Monthly Trend Analysis
-City-level and Property-level breakdown
-Channel-level revenue analysis (Direct, Online, Offline)
-Weekend vs Weekday performance comparison
-Interactive slicers for dynamic filtering

4.5 Stakeholder-Driven Enhancements

-Incorporated feedback from revenue management perspective
-Added Week-on-Week performance tracking
-Included weekend vs weekday segmentation
-Implemented channel-level analysis for pricing evaluation
-Structured dashboard for Level 1 (overview) and Level 2 (drill-down) analysis

Key Insights

-RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy are primary drivers of revenue performance.
-The pricing strategy appears flat across weekdays and weekends, indicating opportunity for dynamic pricing optimization.
-Hotels with lower occupancy often show lower ratings and higher cancellation rates.
-Channel-level ADR differences require careful pricing strategy to avoid ranking penalties.
-Weekend vs weekday segmentation reveals different customer behavior patterns.

Business Impact

The dashboard enables management to:
-Monitor hotel performance in real time
-Identify underperforming cities or properties
-Evaluate pricing and booking channel strategies
-Optimize occupancy and revenue management
-Support strategic decision-making with data
This project demonstrates strong understanding of hospitality KPIs, data modeling, DAX logic, and stakeholder-focused dashboard design.
